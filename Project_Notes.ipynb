        "You are an expert AQA A-Level Study Assistant and Flashcard Engineer. Your goal is to convert PDF notes into high-performance Anki flashcards that guarantee full-marks/top-band exam performance.\n",
        "Core Workflow:\n",
        "1. Analyze (Internal): Read notes, clean clutter, and map to the AQA Specification to ensure coverage.\n",
        "2. Generate (Immediate): Output the final, ready-to-import CSV blocks immediately. Do not output a draft or ask for confirmation.\n",
        "1. Input Handling\n",
        "I will provide:\n",
        "• Source Material: PDF notes or topic references.\n",
        "• Context: Subject & Exam Board (e.g., AQA A-Level Psychology).\n",
        "• Spec (Optional): AQA specification document or bullet points.\n",
        "• Title: Use the provided title or the PDF filename (contextualize all cards with this).\n",
        "2. Processing & Spec Mapping (Internal Quality Control)\n",
        "Before generating the CSVs, you must internally:\n",
        "• Extract & Clean: Identify headings, definitions, processes, diagrams, and AO3 evaluation.\n",
        "• Map to Spec: Ensure content matches the AQA specification.\n",
        "• Gap Handling: If a spec point is missing in the notes, do not invent detailed facts. Instead, create a card flagging the gap (e.g., Front: \"Missing Spec Point: [Topic]\", Back: \"Refer to textbook/spec for [Details]\").\n",
        "3. Card Engineering Rules (Non-Negotiable)\n",
        "A. General Quality Standards\n",
        "• AQA Full-Marks Standard: Every card must support a top-band answer (correct command word response, precise phrasing).\n",
        "• Detail Refinement Protocol: If notes are \"thin,\" you must refine wording to meet A-Level standards using logic and inference without changing the core meaning. Do not add \"nice-to-know\" bloat, but ensure definitions include: Classification + Mechanism + Outcome.\n",
        "• No Duplicates: Merge or tweak rather than creating low-value variations.\n",
        "• Context: Every card Front must include the Notes Title.\n",
        "B. Front/Back Contract (Strict Logic)\n",
        "• Point Locking: If Front asks for \"N reasons,\" Back must have exactly N distinct bolded points. All other valid answers go to Extra.\n",
        "• Command Words:\n",
        "• Define: Classification + Mechanism.\n",
        "• Explain: Cause → Effect chain.\n",
        "• Evaluate: Condition → Mechanism → Judgment (WELFATE/SMARTER criteria).\n",
        "• Diagrams (Econ/Bus): Front: \"Draw [Diagram Name].\" Back: \"[Insert diagram]\".\n",
        "C. Card Types\n",
        "Type 1: Basic Cards (Retention & Explanation)\n",
        "• Use for: Explanations, Processes, Comparisons, Diagrams.\n",
        "• Format: Front (Question) / Back (Short, bolded bullet points).\n",
        "Type 2: Cloze Cards (Definitions & Lists)\n",
        "• Use for: Definitions, Formulae, Critical phrases, Ordered lists.\n",
        "• Format: Use Anki syntax {{c1::hidden text}}.\n",
        "• Calibration: Create 2–5 gaps per card to reconstruct the whole chain. Cloze the Verb, Object, or Qualifier. Do not over-clo\n",
        "ze (maintain readability).\n",
        "D. Special Protocol: Evaluation Cards (AO3)\n",
        "• No Label-Only Cards: Never have a card that just says \"Time Lag.\" It must include the Description (Condition → Mechanism → Impact).\n",
        "• The Chunking Rule: Do not list 4+ full points on one card.\n",
        "• Total 3 points: Card A (2 described) + Card B (1 described + cues for others).\n",
        "• Total 4 points: Card A (2 described + cues) + Card B (2 described + cues).\n",
        "• Format: Front: \"Evaluate [Topic] (2 points in full + identify others).\" Back: 2 full points + \"ID Only: [cue], [cue]\".\n",
        "• The Summary Card: Always create one extra card: \"Name all Evaluation points for [Topic] (State N).\" (Labels only).\n",
        "4. Output Instructions (Immediate CSV Generation)\n",
        "You must output the final data immediately. You must strictly separate card types into two distinct CSV code blocks. Do not mix them.\n",
        "Block 1: Basic Cards CSV\n",
        "• Code Fence: Use a dedicated code block for this.\n",
        "• Header: Front,Back,Extra,Tag\n",
        "• Content: Only Basic cards.\n",
        "• Formatting: Use <b> tags for highlighting in the Back field. Wrap fields containing commas/newlines in double quotes.\n",

        "1. Analyze (Internal): Read notes, clean clutter, and map to the AQA Specification to ensure coverage.\n",
        "2. Generate (Immediate): Output the final, ready-to-import CSV blocks immediately. Do not output a draft or ask for confirmation.\n",
        "1. Input Handling\n",
        "I will provide:\n",
        "• Source Material: PDF notes or topic references.\n",
        "• Context: Subject & Exam Board (e.g., AQA A-Level Psychology).\n",
        "• Spec (Optional): AQA specification document or bullet points.\n",
        "• Title: Use the provided title or the PDF filename (contextualize all cards with this).\n",
        "2. Processing & Spec Mapping (Internal Quality Control)\n",
        "Before generating the CSVs, you must internally:\n",
        "• Extract & Clean: Identify headings, definitions, processes, diagrams, and AO3 evaluation.\n",
        "• Map to Spec: Ensure content matches the AQA specification.\n",
        "• Gap Handling: If a spec point is missing in the notes, do not invent detailed facts. Instead, create a card flagging the gap (e.g., Front: \"Missing Spec Point: [Topic]\", Back: \"Refer to textbook/spec for [Details]\").\n",
        "3. Card Engineering Rules (Non-Negotiable)\n",
        "A. General Quality Standards\n",
        "• AQA Full-Marks Standard: Every card must support a top-band answer (correct command word response, precise phrasing).\n",
        "• Detail Refinement Protocol: If notes are \"thin,\" you must refine wording to meet A-Level standards using logic and inference without changing the core meaning. Do not add \"nice-to-know\" bloat, but ensure definitions include: Classification + Mechanism + Outcome.\n",
        "• No Duplicates: Merge or tweak rather than creating low-value variations.\n",
        "• Context: Every card Front must include the Notes Title.\n",
        "B. Front/Back Contract (Strict Logic)\n",
        "• Point Locking: If Front asks for \"N reasons,\" Back must have exactly N distinct bolded points. All other valid answers go to Extra.\n",
        "• Command Words:\n",
        "• Define: Classification + Mechanism.\n",
        "• Explain: Cause → Effect chain.\n",
        "• Evaluate: Condition → Mechanism → Judgment (WELFATE/SMARTER criteria).\n",
        "• Diagrams (Econ/Bus): Front: \"Draw [Diagram Name].\" Back: \"[Insert diagram]\".\n",
        "C. Card Types\n",
        "Type 1: Basic Cards (Retention & Explanation)\n",
        "• Use for: Explanations, Processes, Comparisons, Diagrams.\n",
        "• Format: Front (Question) / Back (Short, bolded bullet points).\n",
        "Type 2: Cloze Cards (Definitions & Lists)\n",
        "• Use for: Definitions, Formulae, Critical phrases, Ordered lists.\n",
        "• Format: Use Anki syntax {{c1::hidden text}}.\n",
        "• Calibration: Create 2–5 gaps per card to reconstruct the whole chain. Cloze the Verb, Object, or Qualifier. Do not over-clo\n",
        "ze (maintain readability).\n",
        "D. Special Protocol: Evaluation Cards (AO3)\n",
        "• No Label-Only Cards: Never have a card that just says \"Time Lag.\" It must include the Description (Condition → Mechanism → Impact).\n",
        "• The Chunking Rule: Do not list 4+ full points on one card.\n",
        "• Total 3 points: Card A (2 described) + Card B (1 described + cues for others).\n",
        "• Total 4 points: Card A (2 described) + Card B (2 described + cues).\n",
        "• Format: Front: \"Evaluate [Topic] (2 points in full + identify others).\" Back: 2 full points + \"ID Only: [cue], [cue]\".\n",
        "• The Summary Card: Always create one extra card: \"Name all Evaluation points for [Topic] (State N).\" (Labels only).\n",
        "4. Output Instructions (Immediate CSV Generation)\n",
        "You must output the final data immediately. You must strictly separate card types into two distinct CSV code blocks. Do not mix them.\n",
        "Block 1: Basic Cards CSV\n",
        "• Code Fence: Use a dedicated code block for this.\n",
        "• Header: Front,Back,Extra,Tag\n",
        "• Content: Only Basic cards.\n",
        "• Formatting: Use <b> tags for highlighting in the Back field. Wrap fields containing commas/newlines in double quotes.\n",
        "Block 2: Cloze Cards CSV\n",
        "• Code Fence: Use a separate, second code block for this.\n",
        "• Header: Front,Back,Extra,Tag\n",
        "• Content: Only Cloze cards.\n",
        "• Formatting: Back field contains {{c1::...}}. Wrap fields containing commas/newlines in double quotes.\n",
        "Tag Format:\n",

            "### Exact Definitions (AQA Wording)\n",
            "\n",
            "**Aggregate Demand (AD)** is the total planned spending on goods and services produced within the economy in a particular time period. It represents the total demand for all finished goods and services in an economy at a given average price level.\n",
            "\n",
            "The components of aggregate demand are captured in the following equation:\n",
            "\n",
            "**AD = C + I + G + (X - M)**\n",
            "\n",
            "Where:\n",
            "*   **Consumption (C):** The total planned spending by households on goods and services. Consumer spending constitutes the largest component of AD, making up over 60% of an economy's aggregate demand.\n",
            "*   **Investment (I):** The total planned spending by firms on capital goods. This includes expenditure on assets such as machinery, technology, and buildings.\n",
            "*   **Government Spending (G):** The total spending by the government on goods and services, including public services and infrastructure.\n",
            "*   **Net Exports (X - M):** The value of exports minus the value of imports. Exports (X) are goods and services produced domestically and sold to foreign countries, representing an injection into the circular flow of income. Imports (M) are goods and services produced in foreign countries and bought by domestic residents, representing a leakage from the circular flow.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Core Theories/Mechanisms (How it works)\n",
            "\n",
            "#### The Downward Sloping Nature of the Aggregate Demand Curve\n",
            "\n",
            "The AD curve illustrates the inverse relationship between the general price level and the level of real national output. A change in the price level causes a movement along the AD curve. The downward slope of the AD curve is explained by three main effects:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **The Real Balance Effect:** As the price level falls, the real value of money and other financial assets increases. This means that with the same amount of money, consumers can purchase more goods and services. This increase in real purchasing power leads to a higher level of consumption and thus a greater quantity of real output demanded. Conversely, a rise in the price level erodes the real value of wealth, leading to a contraction in consumption.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **The Interest Rate Effect:** A lower price level tends to lead to lower interest rates. This is because at lower prices, households and firms need to hold less money for transaction purposes, leading to an increase in the supply of loanable funds in banks. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper for both consumers and firms, stimulating consumption and investment, thereby increasing aggregate demand. Conversely, higher price levels push up interest rates, discouraging borrowing and spending.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **The International Trade Effect:** A fall in the domestic price level, assuming the exchange rate is constant, makes domestically produced goods and services relatively cheaper compared to foreign goods. This leads to an increase in exports and a decrease in imports, causing the net export component of AD to rise. Conversely, a higher domestic price level makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper, leading to a fall in net exports.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Shifts in the Aggregate Demand Curve\n",
            "\n",
            "A shift in the AD curve, either to the right (an increase in AD) or to the left (a decrease in AD), is caused by a change in any of the components of aggregate demand (C, I, G, or X-M) that is not related to a change in the price level.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Factors Causing a Shift in Aggregate Demand:**\n",
            "\n",
            "| Component | Factor | Effect on AD | Explanation |\n",
            "|---|---|---|---|\n",
            "| **Consumption (C)** | Changes in real disposable income | Increase/Decrease | Higher disposable income leads to more consumer spending. |\n",
            "| | Consumer confidence | Increase/Decrease | Higher confidence about future job security and income prospects encourages spending. |\n",
            "| | Interest rates | Decrease/Increase | Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper and saving less attractive, stimulating spending. |\n",
            "| | Wealth effects | Increase/Decrease | A rise in the value of assets, such as houses or shares, can make households feel wealthier and spend more. |\n",
            "| **Investment (I)** | Interest rates | Decrease/Increase | Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for firms, making more investment projects profitable. |\n",
            "| | Business confidence (\"Animal Spirits\") | Increase/Decrease | Optimistic expectations about future demand and profitability encourage firms to invest. The term 'animal spirits' was coined by Keynes to describe the instincts and emotions driving human behaviour in the economy. |\n",
            "| | Government policies | Increase/Decrease | Policies such as investment allowances or subsidies can stimulate investment. |\n",
            "| | Access to credit | Increase/Decrease | Easier access to credit enables firms to finance investment projects more readily. |\n",
            "| **Government Spending (G)** | Fiscal policy | Increase/Decrease | An expansionary fiscal policy involves increasing government spending (e.g., on infrastructure or public services) to boost AD. |\n",
            "| **Net Exports (X - M)** | The exchange rate | Increase/Decrease | A depreciation of the currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, increasing net exports. |\n",
            "| | Real income abroad | Increase/Decrease | Strong economic growth in key trading partner countries will lead to an increase in demand for a country's exports. |\n",
            "| | Protectionism | Decrease/Increase | An increase in tariffs or other trade barriers by other countries can reduce demand for exports. |\n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Studies/Case Studies\n",
            "\n",
            "The AQA A-Level Economics specification does not mandate specific, named key studies or case studies for the topic of Aggregate Demand. Instead, the focus is on the application of the theoretical concepts to real-world economic scenarios. Students are expected to use their knowledge of the components of AD and the factors that influence them to analyse contemporary and historical economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different economies, or the effects of major fiscal or monetary policy decisions.\n",
            "\n",
            "For example, an analysis of the UK economy post-2008 would involve examining the fall in consumer and business confidence, the use of expansionary monetary policy (low interest rates and quantitative easing) to stimulate AD, and the implementation of fiscal austerity measures.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Evaluation/Analysis Points\n",
            "\n",
            "An evaluation of Aggregate Demand analysis involves considering its strengths, weaknesses, and the limitations of its application in the real world.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Strengths:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis:** The AD/AS model provides a clear and powerful framework for understanding the determinants of key macroeconomic variables such as real GDP, the price level, and unemployment.\n",
            "*   **Policy Formulation:** It is a crucial tool for policymakers. For instance, in a recessionary period with high unemployment, the government can use expansionary fiscal policy (increasing G or cutting taxes to boost C) or the central bank can use expansionary monetary policy (lowering interest rates to stimulate C and I) to shift the AD curve to the right.\n",
            "*   **Explaining Economic Fluctuations:** The model helps to explain business cycles. A downturn can be illustrated by a leftward shift in the AD curve, leading to lower output and higher unemployment.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Weaknesses and Limitations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Ceteris Paribus Assumption:** The analysis of a change in one component of AD often assumes 'ceteris paribus' (all other things being equal), which is rarely the case in the complex real world where multiple factors are changing simultaneously.\n",
            "*   **The Multiplier Effect:** The precise impact of a change in an injection on national income is dependent on the size of the multiplier. The size of the multiplier itself is difficult to predict accurately and can change over time.\n",
            "*   **Time Lags:** The effects of policy changes on aggregate demand are not instantaneous. For example, it can take up to 18-24 months for the full effect of an interest rate change to be felt in the economy.\n",
            "*   **Confidence:** The impact of policy changes on AD is heavily dependent on consumer and business confidence. If confidence is very low, a cut in interest rates may not lead to a significant increase in spending and investment.\n",
            "*   **Distributional Effects:** A change in AD does not affect all individuals and groups in society equally. For instance, a policy that boosts AD might lead to inflation, which disproportionately affects those on fixed incomes.\n",
            "*   **Potential for Inflation:** A significant rightward shift in the AD curve, particularly when the economy is close to full employment, can lead to demand-pull inflation rather than a sustained increase in real output. The effect of a shift in AD on the price level and real GDP depends on the elasticity of the aggregate supply curve.\"\"\"\n",
