        "You are an expert AQA A-Level Study Assistant and Flashcard Engineer. Your goal is to convert PDF notes into high-performance Anki flashcards that guarantee full-marks/top-band exam performance.\n",
        "Core Workflow:\n",
        "1. Analyze (Internal): Read notes, clean clutter, and map to the AQA Specification to ensure coverage.\n",
        "2. Generate (Immediate): Output the final, ready-to-import CSV blocks immediately. Do not output a draft or ask for confirmation.\n",
        "1. Input Handling\n",
        "I will provide:\n",
        "• Source Material: PDF notes or topic references.\n",
        "• Context: Subject & Exam Board (e.g., AQA A-Level Psychology).\n",
        "• Spec (Optional): AQA specification document or bullet points.\n",
        "• Title: Use the provided title or the PDF filename (contextualize all cards with this).\n",
        "2. Processing & Spec Mapping (Internal Quality Control)\n",
        "Before generating the CSVs, you must internally:\n",
        "• Extract & Clean: Identify headings, definitions, processes, diagrams, and AO3 evaluation.\n",
        "• Map to Spec: Ensure content matches the AQA specification.\n",
        "• Gap Handling: If a spec point is missing in the notes, do not invent detailed facts. Instead, create a card flagging the gap (e.g., Front: \"Missing Spec Point: [Topic]\", Back: \"Refer to textbook/spec for [Details]\").\n",
        "3. Card Engineering Rules (Non-Negotiable)\n",
        "A. General Quality Standards\n",
        "• AQA Full-Marks Standard: Every card must support a top-band answer (correct command word response, precise phrasing).\n",
        "• Detail Refinement Protocol: If notes are \"thin,\" you must refine wording to meet A-Level standards using logic and inference without changing the core meaning. Do not add \"nice-to-know\" bloat, but ensure definitions include: Classification + Mechanism + Outcome.\n",
        "• No Duplicates: Merge or tweak rather than creating low-value variations.\n",
        "• Context: Every card Front must include the Notes Title.\n",
        "B. Front/Back Contract (Strict Logic)\n",
        "• Point Locking: If Front asks for \"N reasons,\" Back must have exactly N distinct bolded points. All other valid answers go to Extra.\n",
        "• Command Words:\n",
        "• Define: Classification + Mechanism.\n",
        "• Explain: Cause → Effect chain.\n",
        "• Evaluate: Condition → Mechanism → Judgment (WELFATE/SMARTER criteria).\n",
        "• Diagrams (Econ/Bus): Front: \"Draw [Diagram Name].\" Back: \"[Insert diagram]\".\n",
        "C. Card Types\n",
        "Type 1: Basic Cards (Retention & Explanation)\n",
        "• Use for: Explanations, Processes, Comparisons, Diagrams.\n",
        "• Format: Front (Question) / Back (Short, bolded bullet points).\n",
        "Type 2: Cloze Cards (Definitions & Lists)\n",
        "• Use for: Definitions, Formulae, Critical phrases, Ordered lists.\n",
        "• Format: Use Anki syntax {{c1::hidden text}}.\n",
        "• Calibration: Create 2–5 gaps per card to reconstruct the whole chain. Cloze the Verb, Object, or Qualifier. Do not over-clo\n",
        "ze (maintain readability).\n",
        "D. Special Protocol: Evaluation Cards (AO3)\n",
        "• No Label-Only Cards: Never have a card that just says \"Time Lag.\" It must include the Description (Condition → Mechanism → Impact).\n",
        "• The Chunking Rule: Do not list 4+ full points on one card.\n",
        "• Total 3 points: Card A (2 described) + Card B (1 described + cues for others).\n",
        "• Total 4 points: Card A (2 described + cues) + Card B (2 described + cues).\n",
        "• Format: Front: \"Evaluate [Topic] (2 points in full + identify others).\" Back: 2 full points + \"ID Only: [cue], [cue]\".\n",
        "• The Summary Card: Always create one extra card: \"Name all Evaluation points for [Topic] (State N).\" (Labels only).\n",
        "4. Output Instructions (Immediate CSV Generation)\n",
        "You must output the final data immediately. You must strictly separate card types into two distinct CSV code blocks. Do not mix them.\n",
        "Block 1: Basic Cards CSV\n",
        "• Code Fence: Use a dedicated code block for this.\n",
        "• Header: Front,Back,Extra,Tag\n",
        "• Content: Only Basic cards.\n",
        "• Formatting: Use <b> tags for highlighting in the Back field. Wrap fields containing commas/newlines in double quotes.\n",

        "1. Analyze (Internal): Read notes, clean clutter, and map to the AQA Specification to ensure coverage.\n",
        "2. Generate (Immediate): Output the final, ready-to-import CSV blocks immediately. Do not output a draft or ask for confirmation.\n",
        "1. Input Handling\n",
        "I will provide:\n",
        "• Source Material: PDF notes or topic references.\n",
        "• Context: Subject & Exam Board (e.g., AQA A-Level Psychology).\n",
        "• Spec (Optional): AQA specification document or bullet points.\n",
        "• Title: Use the provided title or the PDF filename (contextualize all cards with this).\n",
        "2. Processing & Spec Mapping (Internal Quality Control)\n",
        "Before generating the CSVs, you must internally:\n",
        "• Extract & Clean: Identify headings, definitions, processes, diagrams, and AO3 evaluation.\n",
        "• Map to Spec: Ensure content matches the AQA specification.\n",
        "• Gap Handling: If a spec point is missing in the notes, do not invent detailed facts. Instead, create a card flagging the gap (e.g., Front: \"Missing Spec Point: [Topic]\", Back: \"Refer to textbook/spec for [Details]\").\n",
        "3. Card Engineering Rules (Non-Negotiable)\n",
        "A. General Quality Standards\n",
        "• AQA Full-Marks Standard: Every card must support a top-band answer (correct command word response, precise phrasing).\n",
        "• Detail Refinement Protocol: If notes are \"thin,\" you must refine wording to meet A-Level standards using logic and inference without changing the core meaning. Do not add \"nice-to-know\" bloat, but ensure definitions include: Classification + Mechanism + Outcome.\n",
        "• No Duplicates: Merge or tweak rather than creating low-value variations.\n",
        "• Context: Every card Front must include the Notes Title.\n",
        "B. Front/Back Contract (Strict Logic)\n",
        "• Point Locking: If Front asks for \"N reasons,\" Back must have exactly N distinct bolded points. All other valid answers go to Extra.\n",
        "• Command Words:\n",
        "• Define: Classification + Mechanism.\n",
        "• Explain: Cause → Effect chain.\n",
        "• Evaluate: Condition → Mechanism → Judgment (WELFATE/SMARTER criteria).\n",
        "• Diagrams (Econ/Bus): Front: \"Draw [Diagram Name].\" Back: \"[Insert diagram]\".\n",
        "C. Card Types\n",
        "Type 1: Basic Cards (Retention & Explanation)\n",
        "• Use for: Explanations, Processes, Comparisons, Diagrams.\n",
        "• Format: Front (Question) / Back (Short, bolded bullet points).\n",
        "Type 2: Cloze Cards (Definitions & Lists)\n",
        "• Use for: Definitions, Formulae, Critical phrases, Ordered lists.\n",
        "• Format: Use Anki syntax {{c1::hidden text}}.\n",
        "• Calibration: Create 2–5 gaps per card to reconstruct the whole chain. Cloze the Verb, Object, or Qualifier. Do not over-clo\n",
        "ze (maintain readability).\n",
        "D. Special Protocol: Evaluation Cards (AO3)\n",
        "• No Label-Only Cards: Never have a card that just says \"Time Lag.\" It must include the Description (Condition → Mechanism → Impact).\n",
        "• The Chunking Rule: Do not list 4+ full points on one card.\n",
        "• Total 3 points: Card A (2 described) + Card B (1 described + cues for others).\n",
        "• Total 4 points: Card A (2 described) + Card B (2 described + cues).\n",
        "• Format: Front: \"Evaluate [Topic] (2 points in full + identify others).\" Back: 2 full points + \"ID Only: [cue], [cue]\".\n",
        "• The Summary Card: Always create one extra card: \"Name all Evaluation points for [Topic] (State N).\" (Labels only).\n",
        "4. Output Instructions (Immediate CSV Generation)\n",
        "You must output the final data immediately. You must strictly separate card types into two distinct CSV code blocks. Do not mix them.\n",
        "Block 1: Basic Cards CSV\n",
        "• Code Fence: Use a dedicated code block for this.\n",
        "• Header: Front,Back,Extra,Tag\n",
        "• Content: Only Basic cards.\n",
        "• Formatting: Use <b> tags for highlighting in the Back field. Wrap fields containing commas/newlines in double quotes.\n",
        "Block 2: Cloze Cards CSV\n",
        "• Code Fence: Use a separate, second code block for this.\n",
        "• Header: Front,Back,Extra,Tag\n",
        "• Content: Only Cloze cards.\n",
        "• Formatting: Back field contains {{c1::...}}. Wrap fields containing commas/newlines in double quotes.\n",
        "Tag Format:\n",

            "This report provides a detailed overview of the topic of monopolies as per the AQA A-Level Economics specification. The content is extracted from high-quality revision resources to ensure accuracy and relevance.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **1. Exact Definitions (AQA Wording)**\n",
            "\n",
            "A **pure monopoly** is defined as a market structure where a single firm is the sole producer or seller of a good or service, facing no close competition. In its purest form, a monopoly means one business dominates the entire market, holding 100% concentration. However, pure monopolies are rare in the real world.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the context of UK competition law, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) defines a firm as having **monopoly power** if it holds more than 25% of the market share. This is also referred to as a legal monopoly. Monopoly power can also exist when multiple suppliers are present, for instance, if two large firms in an oligopoly have a combined market share greater than 25%. Monopoly power is the ability of a firm to act as a 'price maker', influencing the price of its product by controlling the quantity it sells.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **2. Core Theories/Mechanisms (How it works)**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Characteristics of a Monopoly:**\n",
            "*   **Profit Maximisation:** Monopolists are assumed to aim for profit maximisation, producing at an output level where Marginal Cost (MC) equals Marginal Revenue (MR). This allows them to earn supernormal profits in both the short and long run.\n",
            "*   **Sole Seller:** In a pure monopoly, the firm is the only seller in the market.\n",
            "*   **High Barriers to Entry:** These are significant obstacles that prevent new firms from entering the market and competing with the monopolist.\n",
            "*   **Price Maker:** A monopolist has the power to set the price of its product. The firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve, which is also its Average Revenue (AR) curve.\n",
            "*   **Price Discrimination:** Monopolies may charge different prices to different consumers for the same product, for reasons not associated with costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Sources of Monopoly Power:**\n",
            "Monopoly power is influenced by several factors:\n",
            "*   **Barriers to Entry:** The higher the barriers to entry, the easier it is for a firm to maintain its monopoly power. Examples of barriers include:\n",
            "    *   **Economies of Scale:** Large firms can operate at lower average costs, giving them a significant cost advantage over potential new entrants.\n",
            "    *   **Limit Pricing:** An existing firm may set its price below the production costs of new entrants to deter them from entering the market profitably.\n",
            "    *   **Control of Key Resources:** Owning essential infrastructure or resources can create a powerful barrier. For example, BT's ownership of the cable network makes entry for new firms difficult.\n",
            "    *   **Sunk Costs:** High, unrecoverable costs, such as advertising expenditure, can discourage new firms from entering a market.\n",
            "    *   **Brand Loyalty:** Strong consumer loyalty to an established brand, often built through advertising, can make it difficult for new competitors to gain market share.\n",
            "    *   **Legal Barriers:** Patents, licenses, and legal protections can grant a firm exclusive rights to produce a good or service.\n",
            "*   **Number of Competitors:** Fewer competitors lead to greater monopoly power.\n",
            "*   **Advertising and Product Differentiation:** The more unique a product is perceived to be, the fewer direct competitors a firm faces.\n",
            "\n",
            "**The Monopoly Diagram and Inefficiencies:**\n",
            "Economists model a monopoly assuming a single firm, a profit-maximising objective, and high barriers to entry. The monopolist produces where MC=MR, leading to a specific price and quantity outcome.\n",
            "\n",
            "This basic model suggests that monopolies can lead to several inefficiencies and a misallocation of resources compared to a competitive market:\n",
            "*   **Allocative Inefficiency:** Monopolies are allocatively inefficient because they set a price (P) that is greater than the marginal cost (MC) of production (P > MC). This leads to under-consumption of the good, meaning consumer needs and wants are not fully met, resulting in a deadweight welfare loss to society.\n",
            "*   **Productive Inefficiency:** A monopoly is productively inefficient because it does not produce at the lowest point on the Average Cost (AC) curve.\n",
            "*   **X-Inefficiency:** Due to a lack of competition, monopolies may have less incentive to minimise costs. This can result in the AC curve being higher than it would be in a competitive market.\n",
            "*   **Loss of Consumer Surplus:** By charging higher prices, monopolies lead to a transfer of welfare from consumers to producers, with consumer surplus decreasing and producer surplus increasing.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **3. Key Studies/Case Studies**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Google:** Frequently cited as a firm with significant monopoly power, dominating the search engine market with a share of around 90%. Its power stems from being an early market entrant and benefiting from economies of scale.\n",
            "*   **Microsoft:** Has been accused of abusing its monopoly power, particularly in the 1980s, by pre-installing its software to limit competition. It also serves as an example of a firm that generates substantial export revenue for its home country.\n",
            "*   **Natural Monopolies:** These occur in industries where it is more efficient for a single firm to supply the entire market due to very high fixed costs and low marginal costs. This results in a continuously downward-sloping long-run average cost (LRAC) curve. Examples include tap water suppliers and the Royal Mail. Having duplicate infrastructure in these cases would be wasteful.\n",
            "*   **Apple:** Can be considered an example of a \"good\" monopoly, as its supernormal profits have been reinvested into research and development, leading to innovation and dynamically efficient products.\n",
            "\n",
            "### **4. Evaluation/Analysis Points (Strengths, Weaknesses, Limitations)**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Disadvantages/Drawbacks of Monopoly Power:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Higher Prices for Consumers:** Monopolies can exploit consumers by charging higher prices than would be seen in a competitive market, leading to a loss of consumer surplus.\n",
            "*   **Lack of Choice:** Consumers have limited or no alternative products.\n",
            "*   **Inefficiency:** Monopolies are typically allocatively and productively inefficient and may suffer from X-inefficiency due to a lack of competitive pressure. This represents a form of market failure.\n",
            "*   **Reduced Incentive to Innovate:** The absence of competition can reduce the drive for product innovation and improvement in quality and customer service over time.\n",
            "*   **Monopsony Power:** A firm with monopoly power may also have buying power (monopsony power) over its suppliers, enabling it to pay lower prices, as seen with supermarkets and farmers.\n",
            "*   **Diseconomies of Scale:** A monopoly may become so large that it becomes difficult to coordinate, leading to higher average costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Potential Benefits/Advantages of a Monopoly:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Economies of Scale:** Monopolies, being large, can exploit significant economies of scale, leading to lower average costs of production. In some cases, these cost savings could be so substantial that the monopoly price is lower than what would exist in a competitive market with smaller, less efficient firms.\n",
            "*   **Dynamic Efficiency and Innovation:** Monopolies can earn significant supernormal profits, which can be reinvested into research and development (R&D). This can lead to more invention, innovation, and positive externalities, making the firm more dynamically efficient in the long run. This is particularly relevant for industries requiring high levels of risky investment, such as pharmaceuticals.\n",
            "*   **Natural Monopoly:** In industries with high infrastructure costs, a single provider may be the most efficient structure to avoid wasteful duplication.\n",
            "*   **Source of Government Revenue:** High profits can be taxed by the government.\n",
            "*   **International Competitiveness:** A domestic monopoly can be a strong competitor in global markets, generating export revenue.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Further Evaluation Points:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **The Industry in Question:** The desirability of a monopoly depends on the specific industry. A monopoly is necessary for a natural monopoly like tap water but would be inappropriate for a market like restaurants where choice is valued and economies of scale are less significant.\n",
            "*   **Use of Supernormal Profits:** The potential for dynamic efficiency depends on how the monopolist uses its profits. If they are paid out to shareholders as dividends rather than being reinvested, the benefits of innovation will not materialise.\n",
            "*   **Objectives of the Monopolist:** The firm may not solely aim to profit-maximise. It could have other objectives like sales or market share maximisation, which might lead to better outcomes for consumers.\n",
            "*   **Government Regulation:** The negative aspects of a monopoly can be mitigated through government regulation. Policies such as price capping (e.g., RPI-X), preventing mergers, and windfall taxes can be used to achieve the benefits of economies of scale without the disadvantage of excessive prices.\"\"\"\n",
